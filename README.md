# MXPT: Masked XCO2 Pre-training Transformer

Implementation code for the paper: **"Leveraging Wide Snapshot XCO2 Pre-training to Estimate Urban Fossil Fuel CO2 Emissions from Space"**, published in *Remote Sensing of Environment*.

## Overview

The core of the approach involves a two-stage process:
1. **Pre-training**: A Masked XCO2 Pre-training (MXPT) strategy to reconstruct XCO2 snapshots.
2. **Downstream Task**: Plume intensity regression to detect urban emission signals.
