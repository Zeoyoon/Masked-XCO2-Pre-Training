# MXPT: Masked XCO2 Pre-training Transformer

Implementation code for the paper: **"Leveraging Wide Snapshot XCO2 Pre-training to Estimate Urban Fossil Fuel CO2 Emissions from Space"**, published in *Remote Sensing of Environment*.

## Overview

This repository provides the implementation of the MXPT framework, a Transformer-based model designed to estimate anthropogenic fossil fuel CO2 (FFCO2) emissions by leveraging wide-snapshot XCO2 data. The core of the approach involves a two-stage process:
1. **Pre-training**: A Masked XCO2 Pre-training (MXPT) strategy to reconstruct partial XCO2 snapshots.
2. **Downstream Task**: Plume classification and intensity regression to estimate urban emissions.
